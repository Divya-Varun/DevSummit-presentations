<h1>Popup Demo Theater</h1>
<p><a href="demos/1-default_popup.html">Default View popup</a> : This sample shows working directly with a MapView's popup. When content is set directly on the Popup instance it is not tied to a specific feature or layer. In this example, it may not be the
    best choice since the content is very generic and is applied to all of the features within the layer.</p>

<p><a href="demos/2-popupTemplate.html">PopupTemplate on feature layer</a> : This sample shows setting the popup template directly within a feature layer. This template is set up to display the title and a very generic field description for the template's
    content.</p>

<p><a href="demos/3-multipleElements.html">Template with multiple elements</a>: This sample adds a a feature layer similar to the previous sample. In this specific case, the popup's template is formatted to work with multiple types of elements instead of
    just text (content). We add the <code>mediaInfos</code> element to display an image of the monster. In addition, we also add additional field information using the <code>fieldInfos</code> element. A listing of all the types of elements can be found in
    the <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-PopupTemplate.html#content">PopupTemplate.content API reference.</a>
  </p>

<p><a href="demos/popup_themes.html">Light and dark themes</a>: The popup has two out of the box themes (light and dark). These can be a nice alternative to the default popup look. </p>

<p><a href="demos/customize_default_theme.html">Customize css</a>: You can tweak the default (light and dark) themes by modifying the css to make changes to the apperance. For example in this demo we set the icons for the light popup to be blue. You can
    also use css to modify the background-color, pointer arrows, size of the icons, color of the icons and more. The developer tools are a quick and easy way to find the css class names for various elements and tweak them quickly.</p>

<p><a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jssamples/widget_extendInfowindow.html">Custom Popup Window</a> : If you need to make more drastic customizations than are possible by modifying the css you can inherit from the InfoWindowBase class to
    create an info window with a completely custom look and custom behavior. </p>

<p><a href="demos/custom_action.html">Add new action item to popup</a> : This demo shows how to add a new item to the popup action pane. The action pane is the strip at the bottom of the popup where the zoom-to capability displays. Here we've added a link
    that shows the elevation profile for the selected feature. </p>

<p><a href="demos/action_40.html">Custom action using 4.0</a> : This demo displays similar functionality as the previous demo but instead of working with version 3.16, we switched it to use beta 4.0. Working with popup actions has been built into the Popup
    in 4.0 to make it much more straightforward.

    <p><a href="demos/Embed/index.html">Popup Content in Side Panel</a>: Here we have some features that have lots of text and several pictures associated with each popup. We can format this content to show up in the poup or if we want we can display the
        popup content in another node. Here we put it in the side panel. </p>
